# Hi there! I'm Aisha Demeu ðŸ‘‹

I'm a curious student from Kazakhstan whoâ€™s passionate about **math**, **programming**, and **debate**. I love solving problems â€” whether it's building something with code, preparing arguments for competitions, or exploring math puzzles.

Right now, I'm working on improving my programming skills and building a strong academic portfolio to apply to top universities.

### ðŸš€ What I'm doing:
- Learning Python and exploring algorithms
- Competing in math and logic contests
- Practicing English through debate and public speaking
- Exploring open source and working on my first GitHub projects

### ðŸ’¡ Goals:
- Publish coding projects and creative tools here
- Share solutions to math problems and cool ideas
- Connect with students and mentors around the world
